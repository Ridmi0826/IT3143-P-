# ðŸ“¸ MATLAB Image Processing

This repository contains a collection of basic image processing operations using MATLAB. The script demonstrates how to read, display, manipulate, and analyze images using built-in functions.

## ðŸ§  What It Does

- Reads grayscale and RGB images from local directories
- Displays images using `imshow` and `imagesc`
- Applies different colormaps (e.g., `jet`) for enhanced visualization
- Uses `subplot` to compare multiple images side-by-side
- Extracts and displays image dimensions (height and width)
- Saves modified images to disk using `imwrite`

## ðŸ§ª Key Functions Used

- `imread`: Load image from file
- `imshow`: Display image with original pixel values
- `imagesc`: Display image with scaled colors
- `colormap`: Apply color mapping to image display
- `subplot`: Arrange multiple images in one figure
- `size`: Get image dimensions
- `imwrite`: Save image to file

## ðŸ“‚ Sample Images Used

- `cameraman.tif`
- `onion.png`
- `strawberries.jpg`
- `cell.tif`

> Note: Make sure the image files are available in the specified paths or update the paths accordingly.
